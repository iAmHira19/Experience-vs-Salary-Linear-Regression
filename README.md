# Experience vs Salary Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict salary based on work experience. The dataset consists of experience (in years) and corresponding salaries. The goal is to fit a linear model to this data and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a simple, manually created set:

| Experience (years) | Salary |
|--------------------|--------|
| 1                  | 35000  |
| 2                  | 40000  |
| 3                  | 45000  |
| 4                  | 50000  |
| 5                  | 55000  |

## Project Structure

- `experience_vs_salary_linear_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the linear regression model, predictions, and performance evaluation.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.
